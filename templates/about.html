                <h5>Work Experience</h5>
                <p>
                    I am a ski industry profesional with varied experience in the manufacturing, retail, and resort sectors. I have spent time
                    on the factory lines for both soft-goods and hard-goods. I have also started my own mock manufacturing business advertising 
                    sewn goods. During my time working with soft-goods, specifically outdoor techincal apparel, I taught myself the basics of sewing.
                    Well, with a little help from my mother and the designer at work... I've started to develop quite the love-hate relationship 
                    with manufacturing. On one hand, a well run factory line is just about the most mind-numbing thing I've ever experienced. But
                    on the other hand I love problem solving, and due to the constant nature of manufacturing, there's always a problem
                    to solve.

                <h5>Education</h5>
                <p>
                    I received a Bachelor's of Science from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst in 2018, with a dual concentration
                    in Applied Mathematics & Statistics. While in school, I was exposed to the Python programming language, and have kept
                    working with Python since graduation. These days, I mostly use the web development framework Django to build websites.
